# Google Drive Direct Download Link Generator

This project is a web application that generates direct download links for Google Drive files. Users can obtain direct download links by copying and pasting the sharing link of a file from Google Drive. <br/>

The project creates a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user pastes the sharing link of the file into the "Google Drive Link" field and clicks the "Generate Direct Download Link" button. <br/>

The JavaScript code analyzes the user's input link and verifies its format. If the link format is correct, the code generates a direct download link and places it in the "Direct Download Link" field. Additionally, it provides the option for the user to copy this link. <br/>

Furthermore, the project includes the "Embed Audio" and "Embed Video/Docs" tabs. If the user's input link corresponds to an audio or video/document file, the code generates an embed code snippet for these files to be used on a web page, and places it in the respective fields. The user can then copy the generated embed code. <br/>

The project also features a "Clear Form" button, which clears all the form fields when clicked. <br/>

This project provides a tool for users to easily download Google Drive files and embed them in web pages. <br/>
